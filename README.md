# Big Country Server & Community Rules

## Basic Rules
### THIS SERVER IS COMPLETELY FREE, DO NOT USE ANY IRL MONEY FOR ANYTHING IN THIS SERVER, IF SOMEONE TRIES TO GET YOU TO PAY FOR SOMETHING LET US KNOW ASAP!!!!
### "100k or die" TYPE SHIT WILL RESULT IN AN INSTANT BAN ON THE SPOT.
### The anti cheat system may kick you for a false positive, if this happens open a ticket and a staff will look into it. Its a machine not a person so understand that.
### Minimum age to join is 18 years old. There will be cursing because thats how adults talk.
### A WORKING MICROPHONE AND TALKING TO OTHERS IS REQUIRED.
### Dont use homophobic or racial slurs to verbally attack someone, there are plenty of other fun words to use trust me.
### This is a ROLEPLAY server not GTA Online, act like such with the rules more in-depth later in this document.
### Respect those in the server, don't be annoying or an idiot or an asshole, if you need an explanation of this you're probably not gonna last.
### MAKE YOUR CHARACTER YOUR IRL GENDER, NONE OF THIS WEIRD GUYS AS GIRLS SHIT.
### IN THIS SERVER THERE ARE 2 GENDER MALE AND FEMALE, NONE OF THIS TRANS SHIT. DONT LIKE IT? DONT JOIN.
### IF YOU LEAVE THE SERVER WHEN SENT TO JAIL OR COMMS TO GET OUT OF IT YOU WILL BE KICKED AND BANNED, THIS IS A ROLEPLAY SERVER ACT LIKE IT.
### NO RDM, NO VDM OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES, ACT IN A ROLEPLAY MANNER, IF YOU DONT THEN YOULL BE GONE SIMPLE AS THAT.
### NO Greenzone camping, Why TF would you get on a game just to sit in one spot?
### We speak english, if you cant speak it or understand it probably aint gonna work, try it at your own risk.
### No hacking, glitch explotation or anything as such.
### Don't spam the discord or any messages anywhere in and out of the server
### Dont sit in the character selection, just get it and get in the city. If you do to save your spot then bye bye. I will get a notification that you're doing it.
### Any clip needs to be at least 30 seconds long, if its too big to send in discord though I can't help you, so use common sense.
### Know the difference between being a snitch and a legit problem, our staff is trying to play in the server also. If you have a problem with multiple people constantly you're probably the problem.
### Most of the information can be found in the discord or there is a link to the resources.
### Any issues open a ticket in discord and a staff/admin member will get back to you as soon as they can.
### Must join the discord to join the server and have a role within the discord, if you follow the onboarding you will be fine.
### Dont make me add new rules.
### Also I may have mistyped or didnt use proper punctuation, I dont care you read it and understood it didnt you?


## Server Rules/Laws
## Roleplay Guidelines
### Roleplay to the situations you are in.
### Robbing cars is allowed, same with money and player items outside of a safezone, but dont overdue it, make it realistic and fly under the radar type situation.
### Kidnapping follows the same guidelines as Robbing.
### Immediate gun fights are not allowed.
### Don't force your RP style on someone, I can as the server owner not allow certain things becuase I own it.
### Conversations about things outside of the city are fine if you are not in an RP scenario with others who dont want to hear it. If this happens pause your conversation and then pick it back up after the scenario. 
### Dont use out of RP things as reasons to attack, rob, kill, etc. other players.
### You can kidnap police and ems and steal their vehicles, and rob them, but just keep RP going, dont do anything not realistic or Ill just ban this part fully.
### When down/dead you can only communicate to the EMS personnel, dont talk to others until youre healed.
### NO ERP OF ANY SORT WHATSOEVER (RAP, CANNIBLISM, ETC.) THIS IS A VIDEO GAME THATS JUST FUCKING WEIRD.
### When the server resets if there was a robbing, kidnapping, killing, etc. attempt, it will not carry over, drop it and either do soemthing else or initiate it in an RP way later on.
### RETALLION MUST WAIT AN IN GAME DAY TO HAPPEN (48 MIN IRL).
### Multiple characters are allowed, but if you have say a criminal character and a police character, the police character cannot know all the illegal activites location and camp out there to get arrests or use any grudges from the criminal character and vice versa. Basically you forget what one character knows when youre a different character.
### There may or may not be crooked cops, politicians, ems, etc. make a report to the department like you would IRL as this is part of their character and is allowed.
### COPS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CAMP OUT OR HANG OUT AROUND DRUG AREAS OR OTHER ILLEGAL AREAS TO WARRANT AN ARREST OR PULL SOMEONE OVER

## Value Life
### Treat your RP approach as you would treat your life IRL, value it to where you dont just die, make it realistic.
### Stand your ground applies to all OWNED properties and Houses.

## Metagaming
### YOU CAN NOT TRANSFER ITEMS AND OR MONEY OR ANYTHING ELSE BETWEEN YOUR OWN CHARACTERS OR GIVE THEM TO ANOTHER PERSON TO GIVE TO YOU. THIS WILL RESULT IN A BAN.
### No out of character information may be used to gain personal advantage.
### IF YOU STREAM IT IS NOT MINE NOR THE STAFFS RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTROL SOMEONES LANGUAGE, STREAM AT YOUR OWN RISK.
### With that being said if someone says their streaming dont be a dick.
### Dont watch someones stream while in the city to help gain an advantage.
### We all love discord but dont let us hear yours, youre allowed to be in there but make sure you follow the not talking while downed rule and what not.
### If someone retaliates for you that in discord with you we will have an issue.

## Powergaming
### PROHIBITED FROM MAKING A PLAYER EMPTY THEIR BANK ACCOUNT, STASHES, PROPERTIES, ETC.
### ONLY CAN ROB WHAT IS ON A PLAYER, IF YOU TAKE THEIR VEHICLE WHATEVER IS IN THERE IS FREE GAME.

## Gangs
### Gang rules will be added once we get gangs established, they will not be able to occupy drug zones however.
### If someone is wearing a gang color that is not grounds to harrass them, specific clothing items will be the identifiers for gangs.

## Safezones
### No camping in or right outside of a safezone to attempt to kill or rob someone.
### No camping or loitering in the safezone.
### Most drug zones should be or will be updated to safezones.

## Laws (These are in character laws)
### If its a law IRL you can probably get arrested for it in here unless specified, the laws are just following a realistic approach.

## Licenses/ID
### Must get weapons, drivers, hunting, etc. licenses from a cop or the mayor (Big Country). This is neccessary to do whatever the license is intended legally.
###

### Stand your ground is allowed in properties that YOU OWN, and must be justified.

## Drugs
