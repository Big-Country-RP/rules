# Big Country Server & Community Rules

## Basic Rules
### Minimum age to join is 18 years old. There will be cursing because thats how adults talk.
### Dont use homophobic or racial slurs to verbally attack someone, there are plenty of other fun words to use trust me.
### This is a ROLEPLAY server not GTA Online, act like such with the rules more in-depth later in this document.
### Respect those in the server, don't be annoying or an idiot or an asshole, if you need an explanation of this you're probably not gonna last.
### MAKE YOUR CHARACTER YOUR IRL GENDER, NONE OF THIS WEIRD GUYS AS GIRLS SHIT.
### IN THIS SERVER THERE ARE 2 GENDER MALE AND FEMALE, NONE OF THIS TRANS SHIT. DONT LIKE IT? DONT JOIN.
### IF YOU LEAVE THE SERVER WHEN SENT TO JAIL OR COMMS TO GET OUT OF IT YOU WILL BE KICKED AND BANNED, THIS IS A ROLEPLAY SERVER ACT LIKE IT.
### NO RDM, NO VDM OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES, ACT IN A ROLEPLAY MANNER, IF YOU DONT THEN YOULL BE GONE SIMPLE AS THAT.
### NO Greenzone camping, Why TF would you get on a game just to sit in one spot?
### We speak english, if you cant speak it or understand it probably aint gonna work, try it at your own risk.
### No hacking, glitch explotation or anything as such.
### Don't spam the discord or any messages anywhere in and out of the server
### Dont sit in the character selection, just get it and get in the city. If you do to save your spot then bye bye. I will get a notification that you're doing it.
### Most of the information can be found in the discord or there is a link to the resources.
### Any issues open a ticket in discord and a staff/admin member will get back to you as soon as they can.
### Any clip needs to be at least 30 seconds long, if its too big to send in discord though I can't help you, so use common sense.
### Know the difference between being a snitch and a legit problem, our staff is trying to play in the server also. If you have a problem with multiple people constantly you're probably the problem.
